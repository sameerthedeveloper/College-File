# Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) Structure

## 1. Definition:
The **Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP)** structure is a highly efficient arrangement of equal-sized spheres (atoms or ions) in a crystal lattice. It is commonly found in metals like magnesium, titanium, and zinc.

## 2. Characteristics:
- **Coordination Number:** 12 (each atom is surrounded by 12 others)
- **Packing Efficiency:** 74% (same as face-centered cubic (FCC) structure)
- **Atomic Layering:** Alternating ABAB layers of atoms

## 3. Geometry:
- **Unit Cell:** The unit cell of HCP is a hexagonal prism.
- **Lattice Parameters:** The lattice constants are defined by \(a\) and \(c\), with a ratio \(c/a \approx 1.633\), making the unit cell taller than wide.

## 4. Examples:
- **Magnesium (Mg)** and **Zinc (Zn)** are metals with HCP structures.
  
## 5. Importance:
HCP structure maximizes space utilization in metals, affecting their physical properties such as ductility and strength.

# Planck's Constant Derivation

## 1. Introduction to Blackbody Radiation and Classical Theories
- A **blackbody** absorbs and emits all radiation perfectly. 
- Classical theory predicted the **Rayleigh-Jeans law** for long wavelengths:
  \[
  u(\nu, T) \, d\nu = \frac{8 \pi \nu^2}{c^3} k_B T \, d\nu
  \]
  - \( u(\nu, T) \): energy density,
  - \( \nu \): frequency,
  - \( T \): temperature,
  - \( c \): speed of light,
  - \( k_B \): Boltzmann constant.
  
- Classical predictions led to the **ultraviolet catastrophe** at shorter wavelengths, predicting infinite radiation.

## 2. Energy Quantization Hypothesis by Planck
Max Planck proposed that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete units called **quanta**:
  \[
  E = h \nu
  \]
  - \( E \): energy of the quantum,
  - \( h \): **Planck's constant**,
  - \( \nu \): frequency of the radiation.

## 3. Planck's Distribution Formula
Using the **Boltzmann distribution** for energy levels:
  \[
  P(E) = e^{-\frac{E}{k_B T}}
  \]
  Planck derived the average energy of oscillators as:
  \[
  \langle E \rangle = \frac{h \nu}{e^{\frac{h \nu}{k_B T}} - 1}
  \]

## 4. Energy Density of Blackbody Radiation
Planck derived the formula for energy density in blackbody radiation:
  \[
  u(\nu, T) \, d\nu = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h \nu}{k_B T}} - 1} \, d\nu
  \]
  - \( u(\nu, T) \): energy density at frequency \( \nu \),
  - \( T \): temperature,
  - \( h \): Planck's constant,
  - \( c \): speed of light,
  - \( k_B \): Boltzmann constant.

This formula explains blackbody radiation across all wavelengths and resolves the ultraviolet catastrophe.

## 5. Planck's Constant and Quantum Mechanics
- **Planck's constant**: \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{JÂ·s} \)
- It is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, marking the quantized nature of energy in processes such as:
  - **Photoelectric effect**,
  - **Atomic spectra**,
  - **Energy level quantization**.
